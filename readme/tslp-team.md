# TSLP Team

## **Technology and Software**

&#x20;   ****    Technology and software play a major role in every NFT collection. This team is completed by professionals led by Error404 & CyberAngel. Individuals were contracted to work on our smart contract, the entire ERC-721 layout, web development, security and much more.



## **Community Team**

&#x20;    ****     There is not an NFT collection that's successful without its community & following. For this, we have brought in a team of qualified individuals who have experience and knowledge managing NFT collections, discord communities, and general service support. We want to provide you with the best experience throughout this TSLP voyage. Every TSLP collector is part of something much bigger, a family, movement, vision, pantheon and more.



## **Media & Content Creation**

&#x20;    ****     All our content creation, media, and marketing are handled by Ouroboros & Wrenchie. The Media & Content Creation team has experience working with both local & international companies handling all types of needs that range from social media to real products and productions. We decided to go the additional step and make sure all of our content was carried by professionals.



## **Artwork**

&#x20;    ****     All TSLPs were designed by Ghetto Picasso & Lotus, architects, self-taught artists and creative junkies with tremendous skills and passion. If there is one thing you will be amazed by in this collection, it's the amazing characters created by these guys. Over two months of work went into the creation of all our artwork. The final result is an amazing combination of quality, attractiveness, and overall amazing characters of TSL Pantheon.



## **Web Design**

&#x20;    ****     Our web design was done by CyberAngel. His portfolio is filled with amazing work produced for great companies, crypto companies, projects and organizations all around the world. He is the head of the TSLP family for the long run as we keep improving ourselves and start working on the next steps of this project.
