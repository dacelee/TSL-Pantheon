## **The Problem**

&#x20;    ****     The NFT community has poured millions of dollars into projects that lack a solid basis or a team with the necessary professional skills to supervise and manage a multi-million dollar project. Furthermore, and sadly, other NFT collections frequently have extremely low creative significance and value. All of this translates to:

* In a few days or weeks, the collection will be gone.
* Some people profit from fast flips, but long-term holders and investors are not rewarded.
* The majority of NFT collections lacked aesthetic merit and quality.
* Many people are taking advantage of the community's hype and enthusiasm, resulting in fast money schemes rather than long-term NFT enterprises.

&#x20;    We feel that this community has forgotten what NFTs should stand for, and is investing in items with no future worth. In general, we can and should do better as a team and community.



## **Opportunity**

&#x20;    ****     The NFT community has a fantastic potential to produce something that will become an industry standard and revolutionize the way people think about collections of this sort. We are developing a brand that will be a part of NFT history by creating our collection and a staff that is focused on quality and true aesthetic worth. The TSL Pantheon collection is only the beginning of a long list of projects that TSL Studios has in store for the future.
