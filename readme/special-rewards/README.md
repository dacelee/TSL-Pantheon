# Special Rewards

## **Introduction**

&#x20;    ****     A significant feature of the TSLP collection is our rewards to fellow TSL holders. These rewards will range from numbered hoodies and shirts to TSLP NFT art pieces such as paintings and drawings, free spots to TSLP+ channels, gaming tournaments and more. Our goal with these rewards is to give back to our community and help them understand how important they are to our Project. Our rewards are carefully chosen to bring out the digital and physical relationship world elements together. We accomplish this through various raffles, events, scavenger hunts, giveaways, etc. As well as through the beautiful idea of this project.

## **Custom TSLP Sharkcart by Wrenchie**

&#x20;    ****     The Sharkcart will be TSLP themed with custom NFTs printed on the body of the vehicle. Wrenchie is an engineer who also excels in robotics and mechatronics. Besides this, Wrenchie is an avid car enthusiast who has been tinkering with cars all his life. He is the perfect person to design and create our custom made TSLP Sharkcart. We will be unlocking this amazing reward once we hit 25% sales in the collection and will be given out in 1-1.5 months. This is done to give the NFT owner some time to trade or sell their NFT to someone who might be interested in both Wrenchie NFT and Sharkcart. After Minting, we will give Wrenchie NFT holders additional 48 hours to Email us at **TSL@TSLPantheon.com** to represent him or herself to us and have additional KYC, in case to prepare documents where we will transfer full ownership of the Sharkcart.

## **5 mystery NFTs**

&#x20;    ****     We are building a very exciting and intriguing collaboration with other NFT projects and clothing designers that is already underway! We will release more information regarding the 5 mystery NFTs as the project progresses. For now, we would like to keep some special prizes as surprises. Investors will participate automatically in a raffle after purchasing their NFT. Each TSLP = 1 entry into the competition. The 5 NFTs will be available for trading on Opensea, and the winners will receive them within 2 weeks after the announcement is made. This is done to give the Winner some time to trade or sell their winning NFT to someone who might be interested in both the TSLP project and the Mystery NFT.

## **A permanent place in the TSLP, with personalized comic book mini-series, one of a kind special comic book issue.**

&#x20;    ****     A permanent place in the TSLP means that you will have a personalized graveyard in the digital TSL pantheon. This prize is the pinnacle of TSLP. It will be awarded to the investor who will be active all around the project. When choosing the winners for a permanent place in the TSLP, the team will consider many criteria, such as Discord community level, a number of messages in telegram, number of NFT held, etc. This will mark a personâ€™s footprint on the project forever and will solidify their status as a true TSL.
