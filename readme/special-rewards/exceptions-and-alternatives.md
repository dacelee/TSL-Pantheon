# Exceptions & Alternatives

## **Normal Rewards**

&#x20;    ****     All of the normal rewards have their conditions for "unlock.” We have also added the specific percentage goal needed to be reached in order to unlock. The specific details can be found on our “normal rewards'' page. We expect to sell out in a matter of hours, but if this does not happen, we'll honor each of the rewards as we reach the specific goals if this does not occur. We will be giving everyone 120 hours (5 days) to trade or sell their NFTs. After the five days are over, the owner/address will be able to claim the reward(s); all other trades after those five days are over will not change who can claim the reward. Claiming process for shirts and hoodies will be started precisely four days after launch. This claiming process will be open for a couple of days; each NFT owner will need to send us their shipping information to claim their rewards. Unclaimed clothing rewards will be unassembled and repurposed.



## UNLOCKS

&#x20;    ****     - Once each reward is unlocked, we will announce it via Discord and all other social platforms. Each reward will have instructions on how to redeem it. For most rewards, we will require information such as shipping address, hoodie & shirt size, and other information. TSLP Shirts and hoodies will likely be delivered within 3-4 weeks since they are ordered and manufactured after the launch and after all NFT holders have claimed their reward.



## **Special Rewards**

&#x20;    ****     All special rewards have their condition for "unlock" and production times.  Each reward has its unlock goal on the main information page. Since these rewards are significantly more valuable, we will explain each information in more detail below.



### **Custom TSLP Sharkcart by Wrenchie**

&#x20;    ****     The Sharkcart will be built as soon as we meet the 25% sales goal and will be shipped immediately. We will give Wrenchie NFT holders additional 48 hours to Email us at **TSL@TSLPantheon.com** to represent him or herself to us and have additional **KYC**, in case to prepare documents where we will transfer full ownership of the Sharkcart.  In the case that KYC won't happen, the allocation for the Sharkcart will be repurposed for the TSL Holders community. If for any reason, Wrenchie is unable to deliver the Sharkcart or we can’t ship it, “Owner” will be rewarded **$12,000** as compensation.



### &#x20;**5 mystery NFTs**

&#x20;    ****     As we already mentioned we are building a very exciting and intriguing collaboration with other NFT projects and clothing designers and more information about Mystery NFTs will be announced as soon as deals with creators are finalized.  If for any reason, our deals with collaborators and project creators will not work out, “Owners” will be rewarded **$7,500** as compensation.



### **A permanent place in the TSLP, with personalized comic book mini-series, one of a kind special comic book issue.**

&#x20;    ****     The permanent TSLP place in the graveyard will be built in one of the most volatile Metaverses out there! The chosen platform will be revealed in the future so stay tuned! Since the personalized comic book mini-series and a permanent place in the TSLP is hard to evaluate monetarily. We decided to just bridge the gap between the previous rewards and this one by compensating the winner with **$50,000** if the team is unable to provide the prizes.
