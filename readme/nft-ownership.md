# NFT Ownership

&#x20;    TSL Studios and the purchaser of a TSL Pantheon (TSLP) from Minter (the "Purchaser" or "You" or "Your") have entered into this Intellectual Property Consumer Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement"). When you acquire a TSLP, this Agreement goes into force. You have no choice but to refuse to purchase a TSLP if you do not agree with any of the provisions in this Agreement.



## **TSLPs**

&#x20;    ****     The Minter has created or otherwise obtained all intellectual property rights to a variety of different bases, characteristics, and attributes (each an "Attribute"), which will be combined at random to create each TSLP (for example, earings, eyes, hats, neck, body, face, mouth, and material attributes, and/or the like). There will be no two TSLPs with the same set of Attributes. The collection consists of 10,000 randomly created and unique TSLPs that are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Full intellectual and economic rights to your unique TSLPs are included in ownership.



## **Ownership**

&#x20;    ****     You will be the only owner of the TSLPs you have acquired, as originally given by Minter(Your “Purchased TSLP”). Minter hereby sells, assigns, and transfers to Purchaser all right, title, and interest in and to Your Purchased TSLP, as well as all intellectual property rights solely in the specific, complete combination of all Attributes included in Your Purchased TSLP, in exchange for Purchaser paying the price of a TSLP upon initial release. One or more Attributes included in Your Purchased TSLP will be included in one or more other TSLPs offered or sold to other customers, as Purchaser will understand. As a result, Purchaser has no intellectual property rights in individual Attributes contained in the Purchased TSLP, or in any combination of Attributes other than the particular, full combination of all Attributes included in Your Purchased TSLP. As a result, except for the particular, full combination of all Attributes in Your Purchased TSLP given to You herein, Minter maintains all intellectual property rights in each Attribute and all combinations thereof.



## **TSLP Usage**

&#x20;    ****     You are free to use your TSLP for any legal purpose. By purchasing a TSLP, the purchaser promises not to use it in a way that is sexually explicit, libellous, vulgar, violent, hateful, or slanderous, or that depicts or encourages criminal conduct.



## **Resale**

&#x20;    ****     Of course, you have the option to resell or otherwise transfer your TSLP to a third party. However, by purchasing the TSLP from Minter, you acknowledge and agree that all terms of this Agreement, including this Section 5, are binding on any subsequent owner, and that you will bind any subsequent owner to all terms of this Agreement, including this Section 5. (such that the subsequent owner must bind any succeeding owner to the terms of this Agreement, and so on, thus, causing all owners of the purchased TSLP to be subject to this Agreement).



## **Miscellaneous**

&#x20;    ****     Of course, you have the option to resell or otherwise transfer your TSLP to a third party. However, by purchasing the TSLP from Minter, you acknowledge and agree that all terms of this Agreement, including this Section 5, are binding on any subsequent owner, and that you will bind any subsequent owner to all terms of this Agreement, including this Section 5. (such that the subsequent owner must bind any succeeding owner to the terms of this Agreement, and so on, thus, causing all owners of the purchased TSLP to be subject to this Agreement).
