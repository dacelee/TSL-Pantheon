# Overview

## **Introduction**

As NFT owners, there are inherently many questions surrounding our identity. Who are we? Who holds and forms the backbone of our community?

The answer is indicative of the beauty of the NFT movement. The short answer; we don't know precisely who comprises our community. We use our social platforms to express our unique personalities and stories through NFTs and buy our spots in the TSL graveyard. We are not about fake characters; TSL represents our true identities.

We have a passion for what we do. We are all TSL.

This collection consists of 10,000 unique “TSLPs” randomly combined from millions of possibilities. These NFTs are buried on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 tokens. The only way to fully become TSL is by purchasing your own NFT, or in other words, being buried in the TSL pantheon. All 10,000 NFTs will be available for purchase, thereby allowing everyone to join our community. As founders, we believe in buying back the floor instead of reserving a certain amount upfront. We’ve also instructed our staff members not to mint any TSLPs as we'll purchase them from the secondary market.

When creating the initial prototypes, our main goal with the TSL collection was to elevate the design of our NFTs. We wanted our TSLs to have unique characteristics, so we endeavour to create NFTs that hold real artistic value and quality that is unmatched in the community. To accomplish this reality, we set out on a simple goal: create something extraordinary that is guaranteed to be memorable.

## **Project**

&#x20;    To represent us and our community you’ll be able to get our exclusive merch from our website. There will be many different styles, types and categories of merchandise for example clothing items such as shirts, hoodies and much more

&#x20;    ****     The NFTs themselves will be minted in the Ethereum blockchain on ERC-721 standard because Ethereum is the most popular and well-known open-source decentralized software platform. It allows smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) to be written and deployed without the risk of downtime, fraud, control, or third-party interference.

&#x20;    ****     Our rewards program is quite unique. We offer many kinds of rewards, being real-life items such as merchandise or other valuable prizes and also many digital rewards from gift cards, games, and NFTs from us and our collaborators to monetary ones. Our first big prize will be a Custom TSLP vehicle called Sharkcart by Wrenchie which will be unlocked at 25% of our sales. You can visit the rewards page in our white paper and check all the possible rewards.

&#x20;    ****     Our TSLP NFTs are not just pieces of digital art; characters depicted in them have stories of their own. There will be six comic books, one for each founder's character from birth to death and one about their adventures alongside each other.

&#x20;    ****     The comic pages of individual characters will be unlocked to reveal after reaching a certain milestone of the project with randomly generated codes which will be attached to every single TSLPs. Only a set number of codes will be able to reveal one page due to there being only a number of comic book pages(one randomly chosen code will reveal only one page of the comic). The owner of the revealed comic page will be tagged to a certain page and at the Winner, NFTs address will receive an ETH of $500.

&#x20;    ****     To make our project more interesting, exciting and interactive we will host many gaming tournaments for the community. The tournaments will have a wide range of rewards starting from merchandise to monetary prizes.

&#x20;    ****     A big part of this project will be a virtual interactive world, a graveyard where the founders' characters rest. This will also be a unique place to honor and commemorate our biggest contributors to the community. It will be an expanding metaverse as the project goes on.
